99%. It is packaged in a simple application interface while still considering the usability of expected features, aiming to create a modern, efficient, functional, advanced, and user friendly technological tool tailored for deaf children. <b> We used this application idea for the hackathon competition held by Pijar Camp ID, and succeeded in winning first place.</b>
